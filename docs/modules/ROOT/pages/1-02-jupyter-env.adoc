= 1.2 The Jupyter environment

include::_attributes.adoc[]

You are now inside your Jupyter environment. As you can see, it's a web-based environment, but everything you'll do here is in fact happening on the *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science*, powered underneath by the *OpenShift* cluster. This means that without having to install and maintain anything on your own computer, and without disposing of lots of local resources like CPU, GPU and RAM, you can still conduct your Data Science work in this powerful and stable managed environment.

In the "file-browser" like window you're in right now, you'll find the files and folders that are saved inside your own personal space inside *RHODS*.

It's pretty empty right now though... So the first thing we will do is to bring the content of the workshop inside this environment.

* On the left toolbar, click on the Git icon:

* Then click on *Clone a Repository*:

* Enter the git *https* URL, `https://github.com/mamurak/object-detection-rest.git`, then click *CLONE*:

* It takes a few seconds, after which you can double-click and navigate to the newly-created folder, `object-detection-rest`:

Now let's open another tab and connect to your `S3 Browser Console` at: https://s3browser-USERX.apps.DOMAIN. Replace USERX with your user id, and DOMAIN with cluster domain (copy from RHODS Console or OpenShift Console URL)

You can now browse the content of your S3 bucket including a number of images and the model artifact. We will access and work with that model in the following sections.

The _object-detection_ data connection that was provisioned earlier for you and which you reviewed previously is pointing to your user S3 bucket.
