= 2.4 Calling the API from an Application

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Now that we have a working API serving predictions, we can call it from an application.

Until now, we have been using a route which exposes the service externally.  Sometimes, services don't expose themselves outside the cluster.  We'll deploy an application to the same project and can refer to it using its internal service name.

== Verify your service URL

If you followed previous naming instructions, your service should be `http://object-detection-rest:8080`.  You can verify your rest service's name and port on the service detail screen.  

* From the project topology, open your deployment's detail screen. Check the service *name* and *port*.  
Your internal URL will be `http://<service-name>:<service-port>`

== Create the Front End Application

There are two options for creating the Front End Application. If you have time you can build this 
NodeJS app from source like we did for the REST API. If however you are in a rush we can run
the application from a pre-built container which is much *faster*.

====

Use pre-built container::

--
We will create the test app using a pre-built container from a public contaner registry

From the `+Add` menu, click on the `Container images` tile:

Set the container location in the ``Image name``field, enter: `+quay.io/agroom/object-detection-app+`.

If you've entered the correct repository it will be marked as *validated* You can optionally set the
runtime icon from something other than OpenShift, in the example screen *nodejs* was chosen.

Build from source::
+
--
We will create the test app the exact same way we created the REST service, but instead, we'll be creating an `object-detection-app` 

From the `+Add` menu, click on the `Import from Git` tile:

image::s2i/from-git.png[alt text, 800]

Now set the Git repo ``Git Repo URL``field, enter: `+https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/object-detection-app.git+`.

If you've entered the correct repository, the Node.js builder image will be selected since this front end application was written in Node.js.

== Configuring the application

Don't hit that *Create* button just yet. We have to configure the runtime aspects of the application, this is then the 
same regardless of whether it came from source or a container.

=== Set the App Name

* By default, our new deployment will be added to the existing application `object-detection` we created during our previous app.  We can leave that as is.  Instead of `object-detection-app-git`, we can change the *Name* to  `object-detection-app`, but it's not required.

=== Route
For the detection application we want a *secure https* Route so we will use the default - so no changes required.

=== Configure the Deployment Environment Variables

The application needs to know where to send its images for predictions. Earlier, we confirmed the service URL of the `object-detection-rest` deployment.  We'll use that value and add `/predictions`.  This will tell our front end application where to send the images by setting the variable `OBJECT_DETECTION_URL` to `http://<service-name>:<service-port/predictions`.

* Open the *Deployment*  options to set an evironment variable:

image::s2i/create-app-deployment.png[alt text, 700]

* Under *Environment variables (runtime only)*, create a Name / Value pair. 

Name:

Value:

http://object-detection-rest:8080/predictions

NOTE: If you named the rest services `object-detection-rest`, this value should be `http://object-detection-rest:8080/predictions`.  If not, used the observed value.

=== Create

* Scroll down and click on *Create*:

== Checking your Application

You can see a new application has been created and is currently building.  Like before, wait for the build to complete and pods to deploy.

After the application is deployed to OpenShift click on the Route URL to launch the application. 
Try it out from your laptop or phone with a camera. 

NOTE: If you don't want to type that long Route URL into your phone browser, try converting it into a QR code for your smartphone, for instance with https://www.qr-code-generator.com[QR code generator].
